I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in [City and Regional Planning section](https://knowlton.osu.edu/city-and-regional-planning) at the Knowlton School of Architecture, The Ohio State University. My research interests cover global trade and investment, regional economic development, innovation, and knowledge production (especially in new industries.)
